# A simple card game prototype using different data structures and sorting algorithms

## This card game is similar to the game called "Farash" or "Three cards poker"

## The basic concept of the game is that there are a certain number of players and each players are given 3 cards each.
## After all the players show their hand, the player who has the best combinations (“trail”, “run“, “color”, “power”) among the    players wins. 


## Types of data stuctures that i have used are (Arrays, Stacks, HashTables, Binary Trees)

## Types of sorting algorithms tried : (BucketSort, Quicksort, Heapsort)
